Open Crochet Quickstart - a mindfulness practice
Please share or remix with your patterns and reshare.
Motivation: Spread the meme of crochet as mindfulness therapy modality. Makes a good gift for a hospital patient or visitor for stress relief in a medical setting.  The way to teach someone crochet is to start a simple piece for them to get them going practicing double or single crochet. The pdf is supposed to go with a partially started project. Feel free to put your contact info on the bottom if you want to provide more kits. If you can make a decent start to this pattern, feel free to print the pattern instructions quickstart pdf and include it, a entire skein of yarn and a hook as a basic yarn kit for your friend who might like a chill pill made of yarn instead of biochemistry. Mindfulness is evidence based medicine by now. Consider Jon Kabat Zinn's "Wherever you go there you are" for the same idea in a different modality of mindfulness.
tip: Roll the yarn into a ball before you start the project, you could pull from the inside, but it doesn't flow as well and DON'T start the yarn from the outside of a roll because it doesn't flow and is not pleasing to work with. 
tip: Don't give up. it's the hardest at the start and learning a new skill is strong cognitive behavioral therapy.
